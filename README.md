# youtubeStorage

you can run it in terminal like so
./ytStorage.py youtube.com/@ChannelName
and then it will give you the **estimated** storage it would take to download all of the videos as either video or audio

the fact that i wrote it for mp3 and mp4 isnt super *"correct"*, as youtube can also use stuff like .opus and whatnot

*you will also have to give the file permissions, yk if you wanna run it directly*
chmod +x ytStorage.py
